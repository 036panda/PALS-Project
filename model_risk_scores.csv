3,"Age: 63, BMI: 26.4, Health_History: nan, Current_Diagnosis: Anxiety, Race: Hispanic, Gender: Female, Sexual_Orientation: Heterosexual, Weekly_Alcohol_Intake: 3, Smoking: No, Political_Ideology: Conservative, Been_Sad_or_Fatigued: No, Loss_of_Interest: Yes, Hours_of_Sleep: 6.6, Employment: Retired, Socioeconomic_Status: Middle","**Risk Assessment Score:** 5.3  

**Parameters & Risk Values (sum = 5.3):**  
- Age 63 → +1.5  
- BMI 26.4 → +0.5  
- Current diagnosis: Anxiety → +1.0  
- Loss of interest → +1.0  
- Hours of sleep 6.6 → +0.5  
- Weekly alcohol intake 3 → +0.2  
- Hispanic ethnicity → +0.5  
- Female gender → +0.3  
- Retired status → +0.3  
- No smoking → –0.5  

**Rationale:**  
The individual’s age, mild overweight status, anxiety diagnosis, and reduced sleep contribute modestly to hospitalization risk, while loss of interest signals potential depression. Protective factors such as non‑smoking and moderate alcohol use partially offset these risks, yielding an overall moderate risk score of 5.3."
