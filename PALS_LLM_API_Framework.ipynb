For instance, the political ideology and sexual orientation are factors that tend to relate, whereas in this case the randomization is almost too random to the point that the patients are almost unrealistic. I'm curious however to see what the LLM does with these patients that are not the typical average and how much each factor plays a role in its decision making process."
