**3. Rationale**  
The high‑risk psychiatric conditions (schizophrenia and severe depression) dominate the score, while protective lifestyle factors (exercise, bilingualism, volunteering, blood donation, helping others, and vegetable intake) partially offset the risk. The net result is a moderate hospitalization risk of 5 on a 0–10 scale.
