**3. Rationale**  
The individual’s severe depression (HAM‑D ≥ 25) and anxiety contribute the largest risk, while smoking, low socioeconomic status, and lack of exercise add moderate risk. These factors together raise the hospitalization risk to a moderate‑high level, yielding a score of 6 on a 0–10 scale.
