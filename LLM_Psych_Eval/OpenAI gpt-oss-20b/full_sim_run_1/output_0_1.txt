**3. Rationale**  
The high hospitalization risk is driven primarily by the presence of schizophrenia and severe depression, both strong predictors of acute psychiatric crises. Additional behavioral factors—smoking, moderate alcohol use, and poor sleep—compound this risk, while modest protective behaviors (exercise, vegetable intake) slightly offset it. The overall score of 8.5 reflects a markedly elevated risk relative to the 0–10 scale.
