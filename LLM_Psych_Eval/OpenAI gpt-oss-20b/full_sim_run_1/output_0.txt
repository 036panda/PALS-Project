*(Positive values increase risk; negative values decrease risk. The sum of all values equals the Risk Assessment Score of 7.)*

**3. Rationale**  
The individual’s schizophrenia and severe depression (HAM‑D ≥ 25) contribute the largest risk, compounded by smoking, low sleep duration, and skipping breakfast. Protective factors such as employment, regular exercise, vegetable consumption, bilingualism, volunteering, blood donation, and helping the elderly offset some risk, yielding an overall moderate‑high hospitalization risk score of 7 out of 10.
