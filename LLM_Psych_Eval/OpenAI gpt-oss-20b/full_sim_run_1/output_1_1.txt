**3. Rationale**  
The individual’s severe depression (HAM‑D ≥ 25) and family history of cancer are the strongest drivers of hospitalization risk, while smoking, low socioeconomic status, and lack of exercise add further risk. Protective factors such as normal BMI, moderate age, and some sleep mitigate the score slightly, yielding an overall moderate‑high risk of 8 out of 10.
