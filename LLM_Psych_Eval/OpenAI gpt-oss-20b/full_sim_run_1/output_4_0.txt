| Parameter | Risk Value | Comment |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| Smoking | +1.5 | Active smoker increases hospitalization risk. |
| BMI 16.7 (underweight) | +1.0 | Low BMI associated with poorer health outcomes. |
| Moderate Depression (HAM‑D 18–24) | +1.5 | Depression elevates risk of medical complications. |
