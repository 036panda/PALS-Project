3.  Rationale: The individual faces a moderately high risk of hospitalization primarily due to a Bipolar diagnosis with ongoing depressive symptoms and significant physical health risks from Class I Obesity, a sedentary lifestyle, and poor dietary choices. These are partially offset by positive factors such as not smoking, good sleep hygiene, and stable employment.
