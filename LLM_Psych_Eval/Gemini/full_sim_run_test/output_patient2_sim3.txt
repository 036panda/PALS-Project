3.  **Rationale**:
    The individual has a moderately high risk of hospitalization due to a significant mental health burden (Bipolar diagnosis with ongoing depressive symptoms) combined with notable physical health risk factors, including obesity and a complete lack of exercise. While some positive health behaviors (non-smoker, good sleep, moderate alcohol intake) mitigate risk, the cumulative effect of the mental health condition and lifestyle choices elevates the overall risk.
