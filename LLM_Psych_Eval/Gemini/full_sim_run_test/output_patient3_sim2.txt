3.  **Rationale**: The individual exhibits a high risk due to multiple compounding factors including moderate depression, a sedentary lifestyle, poor dietary habits (daily takeout), borderline obesity, and age, exacerbated by known health disparities for Native Americans. While not smoking is a protective factor, these combined risks significantly elevate the likelihood of health complications requiring hospitalization.
