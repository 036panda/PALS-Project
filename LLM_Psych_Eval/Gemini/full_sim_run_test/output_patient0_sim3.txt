3. Rationale: The individual faces a moderately high risk due to severe mental health conditions (schizophrenia and severe depression) and smoking, which are major contributors to hospitalization risk. However, protective factors such as age, healthy BMI, employment, socioeconomic status, and exercise habits mitigate the overall risk.
