3. Rationale:
The individual faces significant risks due to severe depression (HAM-D 25+), smoking, lack of exercise, low socioeconomic status, and critical barriers to healthcare access (no driver's license and no public transportation). These factors collectively elevate the risk of both mental health crises requiring hospitalization and the exacerbation of physical health issues.
