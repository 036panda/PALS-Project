3.  **Rationale:** The individual faces a high risk of hospitalization due to moderate depression, being overweight, lack of exercise, and daily unhealthy eating habits, compounded by their age. While positive factors like not smoking and low alcohol intake provide some protection, they are significantly outweighed by the accumulation of major health and lifestyle risks.
