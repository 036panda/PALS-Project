1.  Risk Assessment Score: 7.4

2.  Associated Numerical Risk Values:
    *   Age: 22 -> -0.5 (Younger age reduces general hospitalization risk)
    *   BMI: 23.8 -> -0.5 (Healthy weight reduces general hospitalization risk)
    *   Family_Health_History: Cancer -> +0.2 (Potential genetic predisposition, minor immediate impact)
    *   Current_Diagnosis: Anxiety -> +0.5 (Can lead to physical symptoms or mental health crisis)
    *   Weekly_Alcohol_Intake: 7 -> -0.1 (Moderate intake, slightly protective/neutral)
    *   Smoking: Yes -> +2.0 (Significant risk factor for numerous diseases)
    *   HAM-D: 25+ Severe Depression -> +3.0 (High risk for mental health crisis and neglect of physical health)
    *   Hours_of_Sleep: 6.3 -> +0.3 (Suboptimal sleep duration, impacts health)
    *   Socioeconomic_Status: Low -> +1.0 (Correlates with poorer health outcomes and limited access to care)
    *   Exercises: No -> +0.5 (Lack of physical activity, general health risk)
    *   Allergy: Gluten -> +0.2 (Potential for complications if unmanaged or accidental exposure)
    *   Water_Intake_oz: 44.0 -> +0.2 (Suboptimal hydration, contributes to health issues)
    *   Has_Drivers_License: No -> +0.1 (Potential barrier to healthcare access)
    *   Uses_Public_Transportation: Never -> +0.5 (Combined with no license, indicates significant mobility/access challenges)

3.  Rationale: The individual faces a high risk of hospitalization primarily due to severe depression, active smoking, and low socioeconomic status, which significantly increase both mental and physical health vulnerabilities. These factors are further compounded by anxiety, suboptimal lifestyle choices, and potential barriers to healthcare access.
