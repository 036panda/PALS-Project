3.  Rationale:
    The individual faces a high risk of hospitalization due to severe mental health conditions (Schizophrenia and Severe Depression with loss of interest) and smoking, which significantly elevate health complications and crisis potential. While protective factors such as a healthy BMI, regular exercise, employment, and moderate alcohol intake somewhat mitigate these risks, the combination of mental illness and smoking places this individual in a high-risk category.
