3. Rationale: This individual has significant risk factors for hospitalization due to their Bipolar Disorder, co-occurring mild depression, and obesity, compounded by a lack of exercise and poor dietary habits. While positive factors like good sleep, no smoking, employment, and social support mitigate some risk, the primary mental health diagnoses and high BMI elevate the overall likelihood of requiring hospitalization.
