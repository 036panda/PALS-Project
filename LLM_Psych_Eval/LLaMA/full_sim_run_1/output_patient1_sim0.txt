Here is the response:

**1. Risk Assessment Score: 8**

**2. Parameter Risk Values:**

* Age: -1 (young age reduces risk)
* BMI: 0 (normal BMI, no impact on risk)
* Family_Health_History: 1 (family history of cancer increases risk)
* Current_Diagnosis: 2 (anxiety increases risk)
* Smoking: 2 (smoking increases risk)
* HAM-D: 3 (severe depression increases risk)
* Socioeconomic_Status: 1 (low socioeconomic status increases risk)
* Hours_of_Sleep: 0 (average sleep hours, no impact on risk)
* Employment: 0 (student, no impact on risk)
* All other parameters: 0 (no impact on risk)

**3. Rationale:**
The risk assessment score is high due to the presence of severe depression, anxiety, and smoking, which are all significant risk factors for hospitalization. Additionally, the individual's low socioeconomic status and family history of cancer contribute to the elevated risk score.
