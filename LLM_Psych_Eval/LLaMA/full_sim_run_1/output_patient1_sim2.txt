**Risk Assessment Score: 6.5**

**Parameter Risk Values:**

1. Age: 22 - (-0.5) (young adult, lower risk)
2. BMI: 23.8 - (-0.2) (normal weight, lower risk)
3. Family_Health_History: Cancer - (+1.5) (increased risk due to family history)
4. Current_Diagnosis: Anxiety - (+1.0) (increased risk due to anxiety diagnosis)
5. Smoking: Yes - (+2.0) (significant increased risk due to smoking)
6. HAM-D: 25+ - (+2.5) (severe depression, high risk)
7. Socioeconomic_Status: Low - (+1.0) (increased risk due to socioeconomic status)
8. Employment: Student - (-0.5) (lower risk due to student status)
9. Hours_of_Sleep: 6.3 - (+0.5) (mildly increased risk due to inadequate sleep)
10. Exercises: No - (+0.5) (increased risk due to lack of exercise)
11. Allergy: Gluten - (+0.2) (mildly increased risk due to allergy)

**Rationale:** The individual's risk score is driven by their severe depression diagnosis, smoking habit, and family history of cancer, which are significant risk factors for hospitalization. However, their young age, normal weight, and student status mitigate some of this risk.
