**Risk Assessment Score: 6.5**

**Parameter Risk Values:**

1. Age: 64 (+2) - increased risk due to age-related health decline
2. BMI: 29.9 (+1) - increased risk due to overweight status
3. Family_Health_History: Asthma (+1) - increased risk due to family history of respiratory disease
4. Current_Diagnosis: Depression (+3) - significant increased risk due to current diagnosis of depression
5. HAM-D: 18-24: Moderate Depression (+2) - increased risk due to moderate depression severity
6. Loss_of_Interest: Yes (+1) - increased risk due to loss of interest, a symptom of depression
7. Hours_of_Sleep: 6.4 (-1) - decreased risk due to adequate sleep
8. Exercises: No (+1) - increased risk due to lack of physical activity
9. Allergy: Animal Dander (+0.5) - slight increased risk due to allergy

**Rationale:** The individual's risk score is primarily driven by their current diagnosis of depression, moderate depression severity, and loss of interest. These factors contribute to a significant increased risk of hospitalization. However, their adequate sleep and lack of other severe health conditions mitigate the risk to some extent.
