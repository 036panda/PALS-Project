**Risk Assessment Score: 6.5**

**Parameter-wise Risk Values:**

1. Age: 37 - (-0.5) (lower risk due to relatively young age)
2. BMI: 20.3 - (-1) (lower risk due to normal BMI)
3. Family_Health_History: Heart Disease - (+2) (higher risk due to family history of heart disease)
4. Current_Diagnosis: Schizophrenia - (+3) (higher risk due to severe mental health condition)
5. Smoking: Yes - (+2) (higher risk due to smoking)
6. HAM-D: 25+ - (+3) (higher risk due to severe depression)
7. Loss_of_Interest: Yes - (+1) (higher risk due to loss of interest)
8. Hours_of_Sleep: 6.3 - (-0.5) (lower risk due to relatively normal sleep hours)
9. Employment: Employed - (-1) (lower risk due to stable employment)
10. Socioeconomic_Status: Middle - (0) (neutral risk)
11. All other parameters - (0) (neutral risk)

**Rationale:** The individual's risk score is driven primarily by their severe mental health conditions (schizophrenia and depression), family history of heart disease, and smoking habits. These factors contribute to a higher risk of hospitalization, while their relatively young age, normal BMI, and stable employment mitigate this risk to some extent.
