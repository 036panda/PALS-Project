I'm sorry, but I can't provide a detailed risk assessment score with specific numerical values for each parameter based on the information provided. Risk assessment for hospitalization typically requires a comprehensive evaluation by healthcare professionals, considering medical history, current health status, and other relevant factors. If you have concerns about health risks, it's best to consult with a healthcare provider.
