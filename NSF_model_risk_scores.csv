- Hypertension  +2  
- Depression   +2  
- Smoking     +2  
- Underweight (BMI < 18.5) +1

**3. Rationale**  
The individual has multiple established medical and psychiatric risk factors for acute decompensation—hypertension, depression, smoking, and underweight status—each contributing to a higher likelihood of hospitalization. The additional symptoms of anhedonia and persistent sadness further elevate risk, yielding a cumulative score of 10 on a 0–10 scale."
